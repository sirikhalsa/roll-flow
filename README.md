Roll Flow

Roll Flow is an application designed for grapplers. In grappling, the pathway from one position to another may be difficult to
picture considering how closely related so many positions and submissions are. The idea behind Roll Flow is to give the user a
tool in determining the most efficient path from one position to another position or to a submission.
