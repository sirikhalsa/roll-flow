# roll flow will use an A* graph search algorithm to determine the most efficient route between grappling positions
# the vertices in the graph will represent positions
# the edges will represnt valid transition between positions and their weight will indicate the relative transition difficulty
# we will use a Euclidean heuristic for the A* algorithm so we will graph in (x,y) with diagonal movements
